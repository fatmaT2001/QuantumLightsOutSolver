# QuantumLightsOutSolver

QuantumLightsOutSolver is a Python project that uses Grover's algorithm in quantum computing to solve the Lights Out puzzle. This project showcases setting up quantum circuits, applying Grover's algorithm for solution finding, and analyzing the impact of quantum noise on solutions, highlighting advanced quantum problem-solving techniques.

## Introduction

The Lights Out puzzle is a game consisting of a grid of lights which can be either on or off. The goal is to switch all the lights off by pressing them, but pressing a light also toggles the state of adjacent lights. This project explores the solution to this puzzle using quantum computing, specifically leveraging Grover's algorithm.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries and quantum computing frameworks:
- Qiskit
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install qiskit matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

1. **Setting Up the Puzzle**: The project includes a function to initialize the Lights Out puzzle with a specific configuration.
2. **Quantum Circuit**: It constructs a quantum circuit that represents the puzzle and applies Grover's algorithm to find the solution.
3. **Running the Solver**: Execute the quantum circuit on a simulator or quantum computer to find the solution.
4. **Interpreting Results**: Analyze the output to determine the solution to the puzzle.

## Results and Analysis

The project includes an analysis of the results obtained from the quantum solver. It focuses on the efficiency of Grover's algorithm in solving the puzzle and the impact of quantum noise. Quantum noise can affect the accuracy of the solution, and the project explores how this noise influences the quantum advantage in problem-solving.
